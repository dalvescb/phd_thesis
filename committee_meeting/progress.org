* Worked On Code Base (known as COCONUT) used for Research
  - added support for optimization solver IPOPT
  - automated schedule generation and added support for stochastic parameter generation
  - updated another code base (HashedExpression) to use as a front-end for IPOPT

* Acquired Interim Results
 - generated schedules for ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) kernels on IBM's
   Z14 architecture (was successfully productized) 
 - generated schedules for core math functions on IBM's MASS library achieving
   up to 20% speedup (also on Z14 and product pending)

* Co-Author Contributions to the Following Papers
  - Using z14 Fused-Multiply-Add Instructions to Accelerate Elliptic Curve
    Cryptography
    - published conference paper CASCON 2019 and won best Paper
  - A Framework for Preadolscent Programmers to Create Cooperative Multiplayer
    Reading Games

* Presentations 
  - Poster Presentation at IBM TechConnect 2019
  - Poster Presentation at IBM CASCON 2019
  - Workshop at CASCON 2019 (published proceeding Two Functional MDD's for the
    Price of One)

* Awards
  - Won IBM CAS's Student of the Year
