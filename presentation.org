* Instruction Scheduling Intro

** Instruction Scheduling
*** Problem
    Given a set of instructions and dependencies, designate an order 
    (find a *schedule*) satisfying the dependencies and optimizing performance
*** Known NP-Complete 
    Practically solved by
    - *Heuristics*
    - *Approximation Algorithms*

** Example Instruction Dependency DAG
   #+BEGIN_LATEX
   \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.085]{figures/graph}
   \caption{Vector Instruction Dep. Graph}
   \end{figure}
   #+END_LATEX

** Types of Scheduling Algorithms
   - *Basic Block:* break code into blocks within branches (most commonly performed scheduling)
	 - *Global Scheduling:* schedule across basic block boundaries
	 - *Modulo Scheduling:* schedules basic blocks inside of a loop, seeking to
     optimize by interleaving iterations
	 - *Trace Scheduling:* tries to optimize control flow by predicting routes
     taken on branches

** Register Allocation
*** Problem   
    Given a schedule, assign registers keeping in mind
    - limited number of registers
    - can't rewrite a register until consumed by dependent instructions
*** Knonw NP-Complete
    Practically solved using non-optimal *Graph Coloring* algorithms and done
    seperately from instruction scheduling (before or afterwords)

** Graph Colouring
   #+BEGIN_LATEX
   \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/nshape}
   \caption{Register Allocation via Graph Coloring}
   \end{figure}
   #+END_LATEX
   Find a *k-Colouring* for the dependency graph, where *$k = \#Registers$*

** Spilling
   - What if a *k-Coloring* can't be found? Must *Spill* memory
	 - Simply insert new *Load / Store* instructions as needed
   - Potentially *creates new stalls* in the pipeline, need to re-perform
     scheduling
   - May use up dispatch slots
   - An *Ideal Schedule* has no spilling
 
* Instruction Pipelining
** Classic RISC Pipeline
  #+BEGIN_LATEX
  \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/pipeline}
  \caption{Example Pipeline}
  \end{figure}
  #+END_LATEX
 Simple example pipeline with no stalls and a single instruction fetch per
 "cycle"

** SuperScalar Pipelining
   #+BEGIN_LATEX
   \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/superscaler}
   \caption{Example SuperScaler Pipeline}
   \end{figure}
   #+END_LATEX
   Superscalar architectures can fetch multiple instructions per "cycle" and
   require more thought about resource restriction (such as limits on ALU's)

** Pipeline Stalls
   #+BEGIN_LATEX
   \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/bubbles}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/bubbles2}
   \caption{Pipeline Stall}
   \end{figure}
   #+END_LATEX
   An *Ideal Schedule* (like in the previous figures) contains NO stalls (often
   not possible)

** Hazards
		- *Data Hazards*
			- read after write *(RAW)*
			- write after read *(WAR)*
			- write after write *(WAW)*
		- *Structural Hazards* occurs when an aspect of hardware is accessed at the same time
		- *Control Hazards* caused by branching, next instruction unknown
    Hardware encountering hazards causees stalls in the pipeline
** Staging
   #+BEGIN_LATEX
   \begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{figures/staging}
   \caption{Example Three Staged Unrolled Loop}
   \end{figure}
   #+END_LATEX
   When performing *modulo scheduling*, a basic block of a loop can be broken
   into stages and the loop can be *unrolled* to interleave stages between
   iterations

** Iteration Interval
   TODO

** Register Remapping
   When executing machine code, hardware maps *Logical Registers* to *Physical Registers*
   - *Logical Registers* are a set of registers usable directly when
     writing/generating assembly code (limited by system architecture)
   - *Physical Registers* are a set of registers actually available in hardware
   Having a larger number of Physical registers than Logical registers gives
   hardware extra flexibility when dispatching instructions for *Out of Order
   Execution*

** Grouping

* Previous Works
** List Scheduling (most commonly performed scheduling)
   	Simple heuristic.  Choose a prioritized topological order that
    - Respects the edges in the data-dependence graph (*topological*)
    - Heuristic choice among options, e.g pick first the node with the longest path extending from that node *prioritized*
    Most commonly used method for scheduling. Efficient but yields far less than
    optimal schedules

** Issues with List Scheduling
    - Many factors to consider when constructing a schedule (everything listed in this presentation and more!)    
    - Difficult (or more accurately impossible!) to consider all these aspects into a single choice heuristic        
    - Combinations of heuristics can be used, and multiple iterations performed,
      but each will usually undo the work of the other

** Optimial Basic Block Instruction Scheduling With Constraint Programming
   Malik,Mcinnes,Beek (Waterloo,IBM).  Found provably optimal schedules for basic blocks using constraint
     programming, using the following types of constraints
   - *Latency Constraints*, i.e
     - Given a labeled dependency DAG $G = (N,E)$ fir each pair $(i,j) \in E$
       constrain $j \geq i + l(i,j)$ 
   - *Resource Constraints* that ensured functinonal units were not exceded
   - *Distance Contstraints*, i.e
     - Given a labeled dependency DAG $G = (N,E)$ fir each pair $(i,j) \in E$
       constrain $j \geq i + d(i,j)$

** Optimial Basic Block Instruction Scheduling With Constraint Programming (Limitations)
   The hard constraints on latency would not account for *Register Remapping* in
   *Out Of Order Execution* that would be able to find more optimal schedules
   despite the fact that latencies in normal execution would create *pipeline
   stalls*
   #+begin_example
   fma r3,r3,r4
   fma r2,r2,r4
   fma r1,r1,r4
   fma r0,r0,r4
   #+end_example
   On a system with only 5 registers and an instruction fma of large enough
   latency, the scheduler would push these instructions apart. However a machine
   could use register remapping to execute these instructions efficiently *OoO*
   making that constraint unnecessary

* Proposed Research

** Constrained Optimization Model For Modulo Scheduling

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\begin{align*}
    \text{\color{cyan} Objective Variables \qquad} & t_i, b_i, f_i:& \mathbb{R} \\
    \text{\color{cyan} Constants \qquad} & \textrm{II} :& \mathbb{R} \\
    \text{\color{cyan} Indicator Function \qquad} & \mathbb{IN} :& \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
    & t_i :& \text{dispatch time} \\
    & b_i :& \text{completion time} \\
    & f_i :& \text{FIFO use } 0 \leq f_i \leq 1 \\
    & \textrm{II} :& \text{iteration interval} \frac{\# instructions}{dispatches/cycle} \\
\end{align*}
#+END_LATEX

** Constrained Optimization Model
#+BEGIN_LATEX
\begin{align}
    \text{\color{cyan} Hard Constraints \qquad}  & t_i + \epsilon \leq t_j \qquad & \forall i,j \cdot i \rightarrow j \\
								 & 0 \leq t_i \leq b_i \leq \#\text{stages} \cdot \textrm{II}  & \\
								 & b_i + \epsilon \leq t_i + \textrm{II} \\
    \text{\color{cyan} Objective Function \qquad}   & \text{min} \sum_{i} (b_i - t_i + f_i) + \text{Penalties}
\end{align}    
#+END_LATEX
*Key Idea:* Encode choice heuristics as penalties, adjust preference
between heuristics by scaling

** IO Penalty
   *IDEA* penalize dispatch time of instructions based on the quantity and
    latencies of it's dependencies
    #+BEGIN_LATEX
    \begin{align*}
            \text{\color{cyan} Given \qquad}  & t_i,t_j \qquad & \forall i,j \mid i \rightarrow j  \\
            \text{\color{cyan} For each i \qquad} & N_j  =  \sum_{i \rightarrow j} \text{latency}(j) & \\
            \qquad & \qquad & \qquad \\
            \qquad & \mathbb{IO}(i) = \sum_{j} \frac{1}{N_j} \mathbb{IN}(t_i - t_j) & \qquad 
    \end{align*}      
    #+END_LATEX
    This is a *soft* not *hard* constraint on latencies

** Stochastic Scaling
   The scaling $\frac{1}{N_j}$ may be a good *guess*, but not necessarily
   effective in practice. *IDEA* scale the *IO penalty* stochastically
   #+BEGIN_LATEX
   \begin{align*}
          \text{\color{cyan} Define a Clustering} \qquad & \mathbb{C} = \text{Cluster}(\forall i \mid i \rightarrow j) \\
          \text{\color{cyan} For each Cluster i} \qquad & c_i \in \mathbb{RAND(R)} \\
          \text{\color{cyan} Stochastic Penalty} \qquad & \sum_i c_i \cdot \mathbb{IO}(i)
        \end{align*}
   #+END_LATEX

** Topology Analysis
   - *TODO* prove stochastic scaling of spans the topology of all schedules
