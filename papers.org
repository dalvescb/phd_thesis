* Pull Parameters
  Gives a map from $R^n$ to schedules
  (essentially a colouring of pull paraemters)
  - is the space of pull parameters that give you a particular schedule connected or not?
  - adjacent schedules (for every epsilon theres pairs of pull parameters such +epsilon yields a different scedule)
  - topology of adjacent schedules
  - how do other constraints affect topology of adjacent schedules
  - how to exchange instructions (while holding others in place) with pull parameters)?
    - possible theorem, anything adjacent in edit distance graph is also adjacent in topology
  - Topology only makes sense for convex problems, outside you have sets of schedules
  - Can we use the non-convex penalties in a way that doesn't break topology (i.e use them just to get a starting pt?)
  - by encoding how to apply a heuristic through pull parameters, can we use the topology to better understand them?
